  <h3>Bee Happy: Bee Pollination Collages</h3>

  <img src="media/IMG_3216.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="A Second Collage of Bees">
</body>
<p> These collages include pictures of Bees pollinating, taken by myself. These collages group images of Bees pollinating different flowers and different areas, including imagery of other bees, exotic flowers, and the production of honey. Bees are something I have always been fond of so I enjoy finding ways to incorporate Bees into my art as well as trying to bring awareness to others about insects like Bees which help our ecosystem. </p>

<h3>Louts Flower Pot: Bee at Peace</h3>
<body>
  <img src="media/IMG_5457.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="A Flower Pot Sculpture">
</body>
<p> This image shows a sculpture I created during my senior year of high school. Our task was to create a flower pot that would be able to house and use a new plant. Being extremely inspired I took the prompt and decided to create a literal flower pot that has the design of a lotus blossom. Here in this image you are able to capture a quick peek at a Bee, sitting peacefully on a leaf of the lotus. </p>

<h3>Ash Tray Full of Emotions</h3>
<body>
  <img src="media/IMG_5458.PNG" width="200" height="250" alt="Two Funny Faced Ash Tray Sculptures">
</body>
<p> This image contains two different designs of ash trays. I had previously created a strawberry ash tray and decided to further my creativity and push my limits by creating more reactive ash trays which include estranged facial features.</p>

<h3>Plastic LionFish</h3>
<body>

</body>
<body>
  <img src="media/lionfish3.png" width="200" height="250" alt="Lionfish Sculpture Hanging From a String">
</body>
<p> These images show a Lionfish sculpture that was created for the purpose of a project which highlighted the horrible outcomes of plastic pollution in the ocean. This project was to bring awareness and prevent as much pollution as possible by creating sea creatures completely from plastic that were endangered. The Lionfish is not yet endangered but they are a great cause of other tropical fishes being endangered. Due to Lionfish not being as edible as other fishes for Humans and other animals in the oceanic ecosystem, they lack predators and reproduce over hundreds of thousands of eggs in the span of a year. Lionfish will eventually become extinct as their population is growing but their food source is depleting so sadly they will be the end of their own demise. </p>

<h3>Rana de Los Tainos</h3>
<body>
  <img src="media/IMG_5450.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="Frog Sculpture Made Completely from Stone">
</body>
<body>
  <img src="media/IMG_3774.png" width="200" height="250" alt="Second Angled Picture of Sculpture carved from Stone">
</body>
<p> These are images of a sculpture which is supposed to capture the essence of culture. This frog sculpture was carved carefully for the span of a few days, each crevice carefully thought and mapped out on paper before physically enacted. This frog sculpture is supposed to have an old Taino feel. (Taino's are the native people of Puerto Rico, these were the first native people to the island before colonization and the slave trade.) </p>

<h3>Drowning in a Sea of Thoughts</h3>
<body>
  <img src="media/sketch1.png" width="200" height="250" alt="Vivid Sketch of person Lost in Their sea of Thoughts">
</body>
<p> This sketch was a randomized sketch idea which included multiple images of inspiration ranging from an all seeing eye to an oceanic all seeing fish. There is a person falling from the sky into the depths of their sea full of thoughts, the other creatures in the sketch help demonstrate the mess of the mind and the storm of ideas the person is dealing with.</p>

<h3>Im Melting</h3>
<body>
  <img src="media/sketch2.png" width="200" height="250" alt="Sketch of a Melting Person Who is Conjoined With A Clone">
</body>
<p>This is a sketch inspired by Clay Face and Venom, with a twist of being toxic waste rather than clay or symbiotes. This person is a biohazard, melting away while a new clone springs out of him in the midst of having a horrible interaction with a spill of toxic sludge.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Outskirts for Passion</h3>
<body>
  <img src="media/sketch3.png" width="250" height="250" alt="Fashion Sketch Inspired by Musical Artists">
<p>This is an image of a fashion test dummy wearing an Tyler the Creator inspired outfit. There are different sketches of different genres musical artists who are also featured as artists of fashion inspiration. These artists are also some of my favorite artists to listen to in my free time.</p>

<h2>Why Do I Create Art?</h2>
<p>I have always been interested in arts and crafts since I was a child as both my parents partook in being creative. Since I was in middle school I have always continued to practice and better my skills in order to pursue art as a side hobby. I enjoy making all types of art and using different types of mediums ranging from collages and sculptures to wires and bracelet making. Art is a great expressive outlet for when I am stressed and it is always comforting to engage in, even when I have artist block or am frustrated with a piece, I still enjoy and ind value in art. I did not follow through with art as a main career path because there are alot of people going into the art field and there is not a garuntee you will be chosen to do something great, especially because when entering a career like art is is way better to have connections. Unfortunately, I don't want to risk my financial stability and happiness to pursue art but it will always hold a special place in my heart. </p>
